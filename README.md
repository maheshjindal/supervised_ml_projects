This repository contains the use of different supervised machine learning algorithms using Scikit-Learn. The following algorithms have been implemented using this library
1. Decision Trees
2. HyperParameter tuning
3. KNN
4. Logistic Regression
5. SVM
6. Data Preprocessing

## Project Dependencies
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Scikit-Learn
6. Python 3.x

## Running the Project
Once you have installed the required project dependencies, run all the cells of desired juputer notebook.
